# 🔐 PyCryptor

A Python script for extreme multi-layer obfuscation of Python code.  
It renames variables, encodes strings in Base64, and wraps the code in multiple `exec` layers for maximum confusion.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📝 **Rename Variables** – changes function and variable names randomly  
- 🔒 **String Obfuscation** – encodes all strings in Base64  
- 🔄 **Multi-Layer Wrapping** – wraps code in multiple `exec(base64)` layers  
- ⚡ **Easy to Use** – run from command line with input/output files

## 🙏 Shoutouts

- ast – for parsing and transforming Python code  
- base64 – for encoding strings and layers  
- random & string – for generating random names  
- pathlib – for file handling
